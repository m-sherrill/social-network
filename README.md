# Social Network Backend

## Description

This project will have the code available for the backend of a social media site. It includes how to set up your database and predesigned routes. It does not have the front end build out and to best test your information you will need to use the application Insomnia. This uses MongoDB and the routes are in the controller folder. Each controller will include a note of the api path to complete each route.  

## Installation

- This application requires node.js. Make sure this is installed on your computer first.
- Clone this repository to your computer. 
- Open the server.js file in your terminal and run ```npm install```. This will install all the dependancies to run this application.
- Update the .env.EXAMPLE file, change variables in it to show your information and remove the ".EXAMPLE" ending on the file name when ready to use. 
- This can be tested locally. Please just open MongoDB compass and start a connection. 

## Usage

- Once your database is in place you can start your server by using ```node server.js``` in the terminal
- You would then switch over to insomnia to test the different routes. Routes provided will account for GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE
